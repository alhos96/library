If you don't have log monitoring in place, if you're not monitoring, say queues for messaging or middleware, there could be a case where the tree fell in the forest and nobody knows. And it's not until you have irate customers coming in and berating your software, and asking why it's not working. And then you have to scramble to find out what's going.Whereas if you implement resiliency principles and techniques, a lot of times, not only can you react very fast, in many cases you can add self-healing. And so you don't even need to page that person in the middle of the night to come in and fix it. It just fixes itself.",

In August of 2013, former President Barack Obama, after having previously laid down the proverbial red line in the sand, went to Congress to get consent to start a ground war with Syrians loyal to Assad. Congress did nothing after months of criticizing Obama for not enforcing the “Red Line.” As has been proven for the past 75 days of the Trump Presidency, for Republicans it's a lot more fun to say, “NO!” You get to blame the other guy and take no responsibility, for seven years, Republicans said no to healthcare, for seven years they said no to infrastructure, for eight years they said no, to President Obama. All the while giggling their way into full control of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of government. ",
